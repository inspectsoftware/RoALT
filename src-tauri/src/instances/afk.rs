//! Anti-AFK. Roblox disconnects a player after 20 minutes without input (reason 267). Every
//! `Settings.anti_afk.interval_min` minutes, each client in a game that hasn't opted out
//! (`Instance.anti_afk`) gets one key press, the way `Settings.anti_afk.mode` says:
//! - Focus: the client is brought to the front for a moment, gets the press through `SendInput`
//!   of Space (by scan code, as a keyboard sends it), and the window that was in front gets the focus
//!   back. One client at a time, about 100 ms each. Only while nobody has touched the keyboard or
//!   mouse for 5 s (`GetLastInputInfo`); otherwise it tries again 30 s later. Minimized clients
//!   are skipped.
//! - Background: WM_ACTIVATE, then WM_KEYDOWN/WM_KEYUP for Tab are posted to the client's
//!   window; the focus never moves, so it runs while the user is at the PC and in minimized
//!   clients too. Roblox may not count posted input as activity in every game.
//!
//! Nothing is injected into or read from the client; auto-rejoin on the 267 kick stays the
//! fallback.
