//! Per-client limits, set through Windows rather than in the client: a job object with a hard
//! CPU cap, efficiency mode (EcoQoS with below-normal priority and very low memory priority), CPU
//! affinity and a periodic working-set trim, sooner if its memory grows (`K32EmptyWorkingSet`: Windows
//! pages the client's memory out, it pages back in as used; nothing is read or written). `plan` adds the settings:
//! the adaptive manager's background limits, the fair CPU cap, the default trim and auto-spread
//! affinity; the client being played, loading or hung, and Full quality accounts, get none of those.
//! Roblox has no per-client frame cap RoALT could set without touching the client; a CPU cap is
//! what lowers its load (its frame rate drops with it). Trim and memory priority lower the working
//! set and RAM pressure, not commit. Process handles stay short-lived and are checked against the
//! start time as in `process`; only the job handle is kept, so its cap can change later.
//! A job outlives RoALT while its client runs, but a restarted RoALT can't find it again (nor
//! knows what was set), so RoALT takes its limits back when it exits (`release_all`), resets what
//! it can on the clients it follows again (`reset_followed`) and sets them anew.
