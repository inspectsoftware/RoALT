//! Auto-rejoin and auto-restart: the tracker loop hands over clients Roblox disconnected, that
//! crashed, hung or stayed over the memory limit (`Tracker::take_rejoins`). With
//! `settings.auto_rejoin` (disconnects), `settings.auto_restart_on_crash` (crashes, hangs) or
//! `settings.mem_restart_mb` (memory) on, each still open is closed and the account launched again into the same target after a backoff
//! (`launcher::bulk::jittered(backoff(settings.launch_delay_ms, recent))`), within the crash
//! breaker: at most `settings.breaker_max` relaunches of one account per
//! `settings.breaker_window_min` minutes. A client stays open until the launch looks possible, and
//! what may pass by itself (no network, Roblox down, a batch, a locked vault) is tried again for
//! `RETRY_FOR`: a short outage disconnects every client at once, and must not end them all.
