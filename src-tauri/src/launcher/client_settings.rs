//! The FPS cap and graphics of the clients RoALT starts, through Roblox's own settings file
//! `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Roblox\GlobalBasicSettings_13.xml`: `FramerateCap` (the in-game Maximum Frame
//! Rate; the client takes any value, not only the menu's) and `GraphicsQualityLevel` /
//! `SavedQualityLevel` (Graphics Quality, 1 the lowest). Roblox's flag allowlist refuses every
//! frame-rate flag in `ClientAppSettings.json` (the client logs "Denied local configuration for:
//! DFIntTaskSchedulerTargetFps"), so the cap can't be a flag.
//!
//! Every client shares that file and reads it once, a few seconds after it starts. A launch
//! writes its values, waits until its client has read them (`wait_until_read`) and puts the
//! user's own back; launches hold `LOCK` meanwhile, so one never reads another's. A client writes
//! all its settings back when it closes, so `spawn` watches the file: a setting holding a value a
//! launch wrote goes back to the user's own (`settle_values`); any other change is the user's
//! own. The user's values and the ones launches wrote
//! are kept in the database (`KEPT`), so this holds across restarts. Only these three settings
//! are touched; a file another process is still writing (no `</roblox>` yet) is left alone.
