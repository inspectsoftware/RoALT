//! Roblox client updates: the version check, auto-update and the built-in installer.
//!
//! - Check: `clientsettingscdn.roblox.com/v2/client-version/WindowsPlayer` → `clientVersionUpload`,
//!   compared with the `Versions\version-…` folder the client is in. At start and every 30 min;
//!   `roblox://client` carries the new `RobloxClient` when anything changed.
//! - Staged rollouts: Roblox lists a version before every PC gets it. A client RoALT started asking
//!   for that version, which got into a game still on the old build, shows it isn't this PC's
//!   update yet (`not_rolled_out`): no hold, no "out of date", for 30 min, then tested again.
//! - Install (`roblox_install`, or auto-update): refused while any Roblox client runs (an update
//!   ends them all), while a launch, batch or auto-rejoin runs, and over a bootstrapper install.
//!   Downloads `setup.rbxcdn.com/<version>-RobloxPlayerInstaller.exe` (≤ 50 MB) into a fresh
//!   temp folder, write-locks it, checks its Authenticode signature is Roblox Corporation's
//!   (`authenticode`) and only then runs it, waits (≤ 10 min), finds the client again and
//!   deletes the folder. Progress goes out as `roblox://install`. Launches are refused meanwhile.
