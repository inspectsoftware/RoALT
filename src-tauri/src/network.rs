//! Public-network guard. Windows files every network as Public, Private or Domain (the user
//! picks it when joining: a café or hotel Wi-Fi is Public). While a connected network with
//! internet access is Public and `Settings.allow_public_networks` is off:
//! - launches are refused (`blocked`, checked by `commands::launch_tracked`, so single launches,
//!   batches, auto-rejoin, the tray and the web dashboard alike) and a running batch stops;
//! - the web dashboard doesn't start, and stops when it runs;
//! - a master-password vault locks (on joining such a network, not again while on it).
//!
//! Read through the Network List Manager every `TICK`. Only networks with internet access
//! count: Hyper-V, WSL and VPN adapters are often filed Public but reach nothing. The network's
//! name is never read: it would show on a streamer's screen and in the log.
